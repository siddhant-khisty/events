# Hashnode blogging challenge

## What is the blogging event?

Every month we will be having 4 tracks. You can write one or multiple blogs on the given tracks. The best blogs will receive hashnode swag.

There will also be one grand prize every month. The prize will go to the one who writes multiple great blogs throughout the month. For the grand prize, you can write on any of the 4 tracks.

## How to participate?

You can participate in a few simple steps.

:one: Write and publish a blog of the given themes on hashnode and use the hashtag `#WeMakeDevs` while publishing it.

:two: Share your blogs on Twitter and tag `@WeMakeDevs` and `@hashnode`.

### How to win the grand prize
Each month there will be a grand prize such as Apple iPhones, Macbooks, etc.

At the end of the month, the person who writes the best quality blogs will win the grand prize.

### Special track
Apart from the 4 tracks mentioned above, we will occasionally be having a special track as well. This special track will be based on a certain theme for the month. 

You can write blogs on the given theme, submit them, and win a special prize as well. 

> Note: The Special prize will be different from the grand prize.
